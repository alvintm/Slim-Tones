Slim-Tones
==========

Slim Tones is a series of simple poetry generators exploring poetic sound through computation. With a mixture of regularity and randomness, short words — called slim tones — are created. Emphasis is placed on how the slim tones sound when they are spoken out loud. These “made up” words are combined with regular English words to produce incantatory poems. 

The series devolves in the creation of the slim tones, and in their inclusion within the main poetic text, as one sequentially progresses through it.
