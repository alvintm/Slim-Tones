Slim-Tones
==========

Slim Tones is a series of simple poetry generators exploring poetic sound through randomness with computation. Short words, called slim tones, are created with a mixture of regularity and randomness. Emphasis is placed on how the slim tones sound when they are spoken out loud. These “made up” words are then combined with regular English words to produce incantatory poems. 

The series devolves in the creation of the slim tones, and in their inclusion within the main poetic text, as one sequentially progresses through it. The first episode, Slim Tones: Anyone Can Stam, incorporates a small selection of english words with a variegated array of “English sounding” words. Regularity is enforced in the structure of the poem, and randomness is introduced primarily through the slim tones. The second episode, Slim Tones: Come Entwined uses source text from Silvia Plath’s “Aftermath” to create a backdrop to regular proclamations infused with randomly generated English sounding nouns and verbs. And the third episode, Slim Tones: Ssatu Warriors, imposes regularity to the creation of non-English sounding words. It also uses source text from an English poem by the same author to provide context, and perhaps meaning, to the slim tones.
